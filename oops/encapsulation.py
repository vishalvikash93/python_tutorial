# account.deposit(500)  # Deposits 500

# Trying to access or modify the balance directly would result in an error:
# print(account.__balance)  # This would raise an AttributeError




# The __balance attribute is private, meaning it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
# You interact with __balance through public methods like get_balance(), deposit(), and withdraw().
# This encapsulates the data and ensures that the balance can only be modified in a controlled manner, preserving its integrity.
