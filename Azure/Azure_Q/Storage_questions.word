1. What is the difference between Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)?
    Azure Data Lake Storage is a high-performance, secure data lake designed for big data analytics workloads.
    ADLS Gen2 builds on Azure Blob Storage and adds features such as hierarchical namespace, fine-grained access control,
    and optimized performance for analytics.
2. Explain the concept of "Access Tiers" in Azure Blob Storage.
    Access Tiers in Azure Blob Storage define the cost and performance characteristics of the storage based on how often data is accessed.
    There are three tiers:
    Hot: Optimized for frequently accessed data.
    Cool: Optimized for infrequent access but requires lower storage costs.
    Archive: Designed for rarely accessed data and has the lowest cost but higher access latency.
3. How does Azure Storage handle data redundancy?
    Azure Storage offers several redundancy options:
        Locally Redundant Storage (LRS)
        Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)
        Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS)
        Read-Access Geo-Redundant Storage (GZRS)
4. What is Azure Storage, and what are the different types of storage available in Azure?
   Azure Storage is a cloud-based storage solution that provides scalable and secure storage for various data types. The different types of storage include:
    Azure Blob/ADLS
    Azure File Share
    Azure Queue
    Azure Table

5. Explain the concept of "Soft Delete" in Azure Blob Storage.
    Soft Delete is a feature that allows you to recover blobs that have been deleted. When Soft Delete is enabled, deleted blobs are
    retained for a configured retention period, allowing you to recover them within that period.
