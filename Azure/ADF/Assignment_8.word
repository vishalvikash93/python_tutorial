1. Create a pipeline to fetch the All countries data from Rest API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) and save it as parquet file in ADLS.
2. Create a pipeline to fetch the 5 countries (india,us,uk,china,russia) data from Rest API (https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/{name}  here replace the {name} with Country name like https://restcountries.com/v3.1/name/us) and save it in separate file as JSON with File name equal to Country name.

3. Add the trigger to above pipeline in such a way that it will automatically run two times in a day ( 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM IST)
    Tip: Incase you can't able to do Q2, do this on Q1
4. Now to make it more realistic, as soon as any copy activity fails in the above pipeline send an automated email to notify user.
5. Make the mail more generic by sending the Pipeline name, Stauts, SenderMailiD, and Name within the mail. Ensure mail will come in case of both success and Fail.
6. Once a file for India gets generated trigger a pipeline that will copy the India.json file as CSV into the ADLS account.
